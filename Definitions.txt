Backgrounds
To select a time of day for a background simply add any of the following tags to the name of the location:
_dawn
_morning
_sunset
_evening
_night

The only exceptions are that backgrounds that end in "_day", simply replace "day" with the appropriate time tag.
Examples:
image bg sayori_bedroom_dawn
image bg class_morning
image bg residential_sunset
image bg club_evening
image bg house_night

If you want to flip a background vertically or horizontally just add "v_" or "h_" before the name.
(these are not currently compatible with the different times of day yet, I'll add them in an update at a later time)
Examples:
image bg h_corridor
image bg v_club_day2_day

Characters
To set a character to the appropriate time coloration simply add the first letter of the time's name to the beginning of the character pose.
Examples:
sayori d1a
natsuki m42bd
yuri s3y6
monika n5a

New Poses
I've added a few new poses that everyone can use in their mods. They are also compatible with the time system.
Here are the following new poses:

Sayori
-New "z" face, just add to any given standard pose for both her uniform and casual outfits
-sayori 5e and sayori 5f, two new alternate face for her finger-tapping pose

Natsuki
-natsuki 52 and natsuki 5b2, this is simply making the unused "tsundere" head turn sprites usable for both her uniform and casual outfits

Yuri
-None currently, need to get some done

Monika
-New "s" face, just add to any given standard pose for her uniform
-Added 4 new arm poses that increase her number of poses considerably, Monika now has new standard poses spanning from 6 to 16, all of which are compatible with all standard pose faces
