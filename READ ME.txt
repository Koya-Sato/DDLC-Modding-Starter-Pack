About
-----
This collection of coding and images are for anyone to use as they wish.
I did this so that the community as a whole would have more tools and options for creating their mods, and hopefully it'll help keep the community alive for the foreseeable future.
You don't NEED to name me in your mod's credits if you use this, but I would greatly appreciate it if you do.

Feel free to add onto my work as you like if it'll help your project along, although be aware that if you have made new poses for your game using the same naming convention that I have for poses that you may run into potential compatibility issues.
Renaming your own poses to something else will probably be easier in the long run if you plan to use my future updates, because I intend to add a number of new poses.

To anyone who would like to submit new character poses/backgrounds/cgs/music/sound effects, please send them to me and I will code them into the master zip file myself.
Thanks in advance to any future donators, your generosity is greatly appreciated!

And everyone that uses this in their future mods: Keep up the good work, guys!
