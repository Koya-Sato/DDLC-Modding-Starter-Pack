About
-----
This collection of coding and images are for anyone to use as they wish.
I did this so that the community as a whole would have more tools and options for creating their mods, and hopefully it'll help keep the community alive for a while.
You don't NEED to name me in your mod's credits, but I would greatly appreciate it if you do.

Feel free to add onto my work if you like, although be aware that if you use the same naming convention that I have for poses that you may run into potential compatibility problems with updates.
To anyone who would like to add new character poses or backgrounds, please send them to me and I will place them into the master zip file and set up the proper coding myself.
Thanks in advance to any future donators, your work is greatly appreciated!
